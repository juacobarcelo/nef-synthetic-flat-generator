# nef-synthetic-flat-generator
A Python-based tool for astrophotography preprocessing, designed to analyze metadata from RAW NEF files and create synthetic flat frames in DNG format. The tool enables pixel-level manipulation of Bayer data, modular star removal strategies (including StarNet++), and configurable smoothing methods.
